Covid-19 Funding
This project was built using Netbeans web applications with an Apache TomCat backend server. The backend consisted of Java with htmlunit as the web scraper to consistently gather statistics from various websites, such as Google tracking of COVID-19 and the website for the American Hospital Directory. Java servlets were used to communicate the gathered statistics and display them on our frontend html website. Javascript was also used in our backend to interact with the DOM elements of web pages and in our frontend to power our website.
